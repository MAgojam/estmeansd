The `estmeansd` package implements the methods of McGrath et al. (in preparation) for estimating the sample mean and standard deviation from commonly reported quantiles in meta-analysis. Specifically, these methods can be applied to studies that report one of the following sets of summary statistics: 

*  S1: median, minimum and maximum values, and sample size
*  S2: median, first and third quartiles, and sample size
*  S3: median, minimum and maximum values, first and third quartiles, and sample size

Additionally, the shiny app [estmeansd](https://smcgrath.shinyapps.io/estmeansd/) implements these methods.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `estmeansd` from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("estmeansd")
```

After installing the `devtools` package (i.e., calling `install.packages(devtools)`), the development version of `estmeansd` can be installed from GitHub with:
``` r
devtools::install_github("stmcg/estmeansd")
```
